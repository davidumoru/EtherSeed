## How It Works
- **Project Creation:**
  
  Project creators initiate campaigns by defining their goals, timeline, and fundraising targets. They also specify the type of tokens backers will receive in return for their contributions.
  
- **Backer Participation:**
  
  Backers browse through a diverse range of projects, each with its unique value proposition. They can contribute funds in the form of cryptocurrencies, earning project-specific tokens in return.
  
- **Smart Contract Execution:**
  
  Smart contracts govern the crowdfunding process, automatically executing predefined conditions. Funds are securely held in escrow until milestones are achieved, ensuring a fair and transparent distribution.
  
- **Token Distribution:**
  
  Upon campaign success, project-specific tokens are distributed to backers' wallets, reflecting their ownership or entitlement. These tokens may be traded on compatible platforms, fostering a dynamic ecosystem.
